# Merge Resolution Summary


**Branch:** `010-async-processing-where` ← `main`
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Successfully Resolved and Committed

## Conflicts Resolved


### 1. ✅ README.md - CLI Options Table


**Decision:** Keep both feature sets
**Resolution:** Merged both bulk processing options (`--bulk-identify`, `--bulk-store`) and filtering options (`--series`, `--season`) into the CLI options table.

### 2. ✅ IEpisodeIdentificationService.cs - Method Signature


**Decision:** Use main branch changes
**Resolution:** Added `seriesFilter` and `seasonFilter` parameters to `IdentifyEpisodeAsync` method signature.

```csharp
Task<IdentificationResult> IdentifyEpisodeAsync(
    string subtitleText,
    string? sourceFilePath = null,
    double? minConfidence = null,
    string? seriesFilter = null,
    int? seasonFilter = null);
```


### 3. ✅ EpisodeIdentificationService.cs - Logic Flow


**Decision:** Preserve error handling improvements, add filter support
**Resolution:**

- Kept structured error handling from our branch
- Added filter parameters to method signature and logging scope
- Updated `TryFuzzyHashIdentification` to accept and pass filter parameters
- Removed legacy matcher fallback (we don't have `_legacyMatcher` in our refactored code)

### 4. ✅ FuzzyHashService.cs - Connection Pooling + Filtering


**Decision:** Keep our connection pooling, integrate main's filtering logic
**Resolution:**

- Preserved optimized connection pooling from our branch
- Added series/season filter logging from main
- Updated `FindMatchesWithConnection` to accept filter parameters
- Integrated SQL WHERE clause generation for filtering
- Both `_sharedConnection` and pooled connection paths now support filtering

Key changes:

```csharp
// Added filtering support to connection pooling
private async Task<List<(LabelledSubtitle Subtitle, double Confidence)>> FindMatchesWithConnection(
    SqliteConnection connection,
    dynamic inputHashes,
    double threshold,
    string? seriesFilter = null,
    int? seasonFilter = null)
```


### 5. ✅ FilenameServiceContractTests.cs - Test Configuration


**Decision:** Keep both config values
**Resolution:** Test config now includes both `MatchConfidenceThreshold` (0.8) and `MaxConcurrency` (4).

### 6. ✅ ISubtitleMatcher.cs & SubtitleMatcher.cs - Deleted Files


**Decision:** Keep our version (deleted)
**Resolution:** Confirmed deletion with `git rm` - these files were properly refactored away in our branch.

## Build & Test Results


✅ **Build:** Succeeded with 0 warnings, 0 errors
✅ **Tests:** All 373 tests passed
✅ **Errors:** No compilation or lint errors

## Key Integration Points


1. **Filtering Support:** Series/season filtering now works throughout the stack:
   - CLI parameters → Service interface → Fuzzy hash service → SQL WHERE clauses

2. **Connection Pooling:** Our performance optimizations preserved while adding new functionality

3. **Backward Compatibility:** All existing tests pass without modification

## Next Steps
