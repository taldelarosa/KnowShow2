## ⏭️ **DEFERRED FEATURES (8% remaining)**


### **CLI Integration (Tasks 15-16)**


**Reason for Deferral**: Requires significant dependency injection architecture refactoring to integrate System.CommandLine properly with the existing service structure. This is a separate architectural enhancement that doesn't impact the core bulk processing functionality.

**Current Workaround**: Bulk processing services are fully functional and can be invoked programmatically. CLI integration can be added in a future sprint.

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURE HIGHLIGHTS**


### **Service-Oriented Design**


- **Dependency Injection**: Full DI container integration with scoped lifetimes
- **Interface Segregation**: Clear contracts with single responsibility principles
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking operations throughout the processing pipeline
- **Resource Management**: Proper disposal patterns and memory cleanup

### **Performance Optimization**


- **Concurrent Processing**: Configurable parallelism with optimal thread utilization
- **Memory Streaming**: Efficient file reading without loading entire files
- **Batch Optimization**: Dynamic batch sizing based on system performance
- **Progress Buffering**: Minimal overhead progress reporting with configurable intervals

### **Error Resilience**


- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
- **Retry Logic**: Configurable retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continued processing despite individual file failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error tracking with correlation IDs

### **Production Configuration**


```json
{
  "bulkProcessing": {
    "defaultBatchSize": 100,
    "defaultMaxConcurrency": 8,
    "defaultProgressReportingInterval": 5000,
    "defaultMaxErrorsBeforeAbort": 50,
    "defaultFileProcessingTimeout": "00:05:00",
