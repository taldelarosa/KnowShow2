# Feature Specification: Add File Renaming Recommendations


**Feature Branch**: `007-add-file-renaming`
**Created**: September 10, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add file renaming recommendations. This new feature changes the JSON returned for high confidence suggestions to include a proposed new name for the video file. To start with, the format will always be like 'SeriesName - S01E01 - EpisodeName.mkv'"

## Execution Flow (main)


```

1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"









2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints









3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]









4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"









5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable








   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements

6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"








   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines


- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements


- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation


When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### Primary User Story


A user runs the episode identification system on a video file and receives high-confidence episode identification results. The system now provides a suggested filename that follows a standardized naming convention, allowing the user to easily rename their files for better organization and media library compatibility. Additionally, users can enable an automatic rename flag to have the system immediately rename the file to the suggested name.

### Acceptance Scenarios


1. **Given** a video file with clear episode identification markers, **When** the system identifies the episode with high confidence, **Then** the JSON response includes a "suggestedFilename" field with format "SeriesName - S01E01 - EpisodeName.mkv"

2. **Given** a video file identified as "Breaking Bad Season 1 Episode 5 - Gray Matter", **When** the system processes it with high confidence, **Then** the suggested filename is "Breaking Bad - S01E05 - Gray Matter.mkv"

3. **Given** a video file identified as "Breaking Bad Season 1 Episode 5" with no episode name, **When** the system processes it with high confidence, **Then** the suggested filename is "Breaking Bad - S01E05.mkv"

4. **Given** a video file that receives only low-confidence identification, **When** the system processes it, **Then** no suggested filename is provided in the response

5. **Given** a video file with high-confidence identification and the rename flag enabled, **When** the system processes it, **Then** the video file is automatically renamed to the suggested filename and the JSON response confirms the rename action

### Edge Cases


- What happens when the series name contains Windows-disallowed characters (< > : " | ? * \)?
- How does the system handle very long series or episode names that would exceed the 260-character Windows filename limit?
- What happens when episode name is missing or unknown? (Format: "SeriesName - S##E##.ext")
- How does the system handle multiple consecutive spaces after character replacement?
- What happens when the rename flag is enabled but a file with the suggested filename already exists?
- How does the system handle file renaming failures due to permission issues or file locks?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements


- **FR-001**: System MUST include a "suggestedFilename" field in JSON responses when episode identification confidence is high
- **FR-002**: System MUST format suggested filenames using the pattern "SeriesName - S##E## - EpisodeName.mkv"
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve the original file extension when generating suggested filenames
- **FR-004**: System MUST sanitize series and episode names to ensure Windows filesystem compatibility by replacing disallowed characters with spaces
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure suggested filenames do not exceed 260 characters total length (Windows filesystem limit)
- **FR-006**: System MUST replace Windows-disallowed characters (< > : " | ? * \) with single spaces in series and episode names
- **FR-007**: System MUST only provide filename suggestions for high-confidence episode identifications
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle missing episode names by omitting the episode name and final hyphen separator, using format "SeriesName - S##E##.ext"
- **FR-009**: System MUST update the SQLite database schema to include a new nullable "EpisodeName" column for storing episode names
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a "rename" flag that when enabled, automatically renames the processed video file to the suggested filename
- **FR-011**: System MUST only perform file renaming when both high-confidence identification is achieved and the rename flag is enabled

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*


- **Episode Identification Result**: Enhanced with suggested filename field, includes confidence level and formatted name components
- **Suggested Filename**: Standardized filename following "SeriesName - S##E## - EpisodeName.ext" format with Windows-compatible characters and length limits
- **Database Schema**: Updated SQLite database with new nullable "EpisodeName" column to store episode names for filename generation
