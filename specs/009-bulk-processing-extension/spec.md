# Feature Specification: Bulk Processing Extension with Fuzzy Hashing Plus


**Feature Branch**: `009-bulk-processing-extension`
**Created**: September 13, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The app will now accept individual video files or a directory as input for bulk processing. This extends the existing fuzzy hashing and configuration system with comprehensive bulk processing capabilities."

## Execution Flow (main)


```

1. Parse user description from Input
   → Key concepts identified: bulk processing, directory input, individual file input









2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: users processing files and directories in bulk








   → Actions: processing individual files, processing directories, recursive discovery
   → Data: video files, directory structures, processing results, progress feedback
   → Constraints: support for both single files and directories, recursive processing

3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked bulk processing workflow and progress reporting requirements









4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: select input (file/directory) → process → view results









5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable and specific to bulk processing functionality









6. Identify Key Entities
   → InputProcessor, ProcessingResult, BulkProcessor entities









7. Run Review Checklist
   → Bulk processing details and performance considerations reviewed









8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines


- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### Primary User Story


As a user managing large video collections, I need the ability to process either individual video files or entire directories containing multiple video files so that I can efficiently identify and organize large amounts of content without having to process files one at a time.

The system should support both single file processing for quick identification tasks and bulk directory processing for comprehensive library organization, with progress feedback and error handling for large-scale operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios


1. **Given** a single video file path as input, **When** processing the file, **Then** the system identifies and processes that individual file
2. **Given** a directory containing multiple video files as input, **When** processing the directory, **Then** the system recursively discovers and processes all video files in the directory
3. **Given** a directory with mixed file types, **When** processing the directory, **Then** the system only processes video files and skips non-video files with appropriate logging
4. **Given** a large directory with many files, **When** processing in bulk, **Then** the system provides real-time progress feedback showing current file and overall completion percentage
5. **Given** nested directories with video files, **When** processing a parent directory, **Then** the system processes all video files in subdirectories recursively
6. **Given** processing errors occur on individual files during bulk operations, **When** the system encounters errors, **Then** it logs the errors, continues processing remaining files, and provides a summary report
7. **Given** a bulk processing operation is in progress, **When** the user requests cancellation, **Then** the system gracefully stops processing and provides a summary of completed work
8. **Given** insufficient disk space during processing, **When** the system detects space issues, **Then** it alerts the user and handles the situation gracefully
9. **Given** file permission errors during bulk processing, **When** the system cannot access certain files, **Then** it logs the permission issues and continues with accessible files
10. **Given** a very large directory structure, **When** processing thousands of files, **Then** the system maintains reasonable memory usage and processing performance

### Quality Gates & Build Requirements


1. **Given** the project build process, **When** executing build commands, **Then** all tests must pass with zero failures
2. **Given** markdown documentation in the project, **When** running linting checks, **Then** all markdown files must pass markdownlint-cli validation with zero issues
3. **Given** code quality standards, **When** building the project, **Then** the build must complete successfully with no compilation errors
4. **Given** linting issues are detected, **When** running markdownlint-cli with --fix flag, **Then** all auto-fixable issues must be resolved automatically
5. **Given** the feature is ready for delivery, **When** evaluating completion criteria, **Then** the system must have clean builds, passing tests, and zero linting issues

### Edge Cases


- What happens when the configuration file is missing or corrupted?
- How does the system handle invalid threshold values (negative, > 100%, non-numeric)?
- What occurs when filename templates contain invalid characters or patterns?
- How does fuzzy hashing perform with very small or very large files?
- What happens when a specified directory doesn't exist or is inaccessible?
- How does the system handle directories with no video files?
- What occurs when processing a directory with thousands of files?
- How does the system handle file permission errors during bulk processing?
- What happens when disk space is insufficient during bulk processing?
- How does the system respond to interruption during bulk processing (Ctrl+C)?

### Build Process & Quality Assurance


The feature implementation must adhere to strict quality standards:

- **Linting Prerequisites**: All markdown documentation must pass markdownlint-cli validation before build completion
- **Auto-fix Capability**: Use `markdownlint --fix` to automatically resolve formatting issues
- **Zero-tolerance Policy**: Build pipeline fails if any linting issues remain unresolved
- **Continuous Validation**: Linting checks run as part of every build cycle
- **Documentation Standards**: All markdown files must follow consistent formatting enforced by automated tools

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements


- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a single video file path as input and process it individually
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept a directory path as input and discover all video files within that directory recursively

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide real-time progress feedback during bulk processing operations, showing current file name and overall progress percentage

### Bulk Processing Configuration Details


The system uses configuration settings for bulk processing operations:

- `maxRecursiveDepth`: Maximum depth for recursive directory traversal (default: unlimited, -1)
- `followSymbolicLinks`: Boolean flag to determine if symbolic links should be followed (default: false for security)

- `processingTimeout`: Maximum time allowed for processing a single file in seconds (default: 300)
- `memoryThreshold`: Maximum memory usage threshold before pausing processing (default: 80% of available RAM)
