# Research: Bulk Processing Extension for Episode Identification


**Date**: September 13, 2025
**Feature**: 009-bulk-processing-extension
**Purpose**: Research bulk processing patterns, file discovery techniques, and progress reporting strategies

## Research Tasks Completed


### 1. File System Enumeration Patterns


**Decision**: Use `Directory.EnumerateFiles()` with `EnumerationOptions` for memory-efficient processing
**Rationale**:

- Lazy evaluation prevents memory issues with large directories
- Built-in support for recursive traversal and filtering
- Exception handling for access denied scenarios
- Cross-platform compatibility with .NET 8.0

**Alternatives considered**:

- `Directory.GetFiles()`: Loads all files into memory upfront (memory intensive)
- Custom recursive implementation: More complex, reinventing existing functionality
- Third-party libraries: Unnecessary dependency for standard file operations

**Implementation approach**:

- Use `EnumerationOptions` with `RecurseSubdirectories = true`
- Filter by video file extensions during enumeration
- Handle `UnauthorizedAccessException` gracefully
- Support cancellation tokens for user interruption

### 2. Progress Reporting Architecture


**Decision**: Use `IProgress<T>` with custom progress data structure
**Rationale**:

- Standard .NET pattern for progress reporting
- Thread-safe progress updates
- Supports both console and potential future UI integration
- Provides structured progress data (current file, percentage, etc.)

**Alternatives considered**:

- Simple callback delegates: Less structured, harder to extend
- Event-based reporting: More complex setup, potential memory leaks
- Custom progress interfaces: Unnecessary when standard patterns exist

**Progress data structure**:

- Current file being processed
- Files completed count
- Total files discovered (when available)
- Processing rate (files per second)
- Estimated time remaining
- Error count and latest errors

### 3. Memory Management for Large Operations


**Decision**: Streaming enumeration with configurable batch processing
**Rationale**:

- Prevents memory exhaustion with very large directories
- Allows for periodic garbage collection
- Configurable batch sizes based on available memory
- Maintains processing performance while being memory-conscious

**Memory management strategies**:

- Process files in configurable batches (default: 100 files)
- Force garbage collection between batches for long-running operations
- Monitor memory usage and adjust batch sizes dynamically
- Dispose of file handles and temporary objects promptly

### 4. Error Handling and Resilience


**Decision**: Collect errors without stopping processing, with configurable limits
**Rationale**:

- Single file failures shouldn't stop entire bulk operations
- Users need visibility into what failed and why
- Configurable error thresholds for different use cases
- Detailed error context for troubleshooting

**Error handling strategy**:

- Continue processing on individual file failures
- Collect detailed error information (file path, exception, timestamp)
- Configurable maximum error count before stopping
- Separate error categories (access denied, corrupted files, processing errors)
- Generate summary reports with error details

### 5. CLI Command Design


**Decision**: Extend existing System.CommandLine structure with new verbs
**Rationale**:

- Consistent with existing application architecture
- Rich help system and parameter validation
- Type-safe argument parsing
- Support for complex parameter combinations

**Command structure**:

- `process-file <path>` - Process single video file
- `process-directory <path> [--recursive] [--max-depth N] [--extensions ext1,ext2]` - Process directory
- Common options: `--progress`, `--continue-on-error`, `--max-errors N`, `--batch-size N`

### 6. Configuration Integration


**Decision**: Extend existing configuration system with bulk processing settings
**Rationale**:

- Leverage existing JSON configuration infrastructure
- Maintain consistency with application configuration patterns
- Allow users to customize bulk processing behavior

**New configuration options**:

- `bulkProcessing.maxConcurrentFiles`: Concurrency limit (default: 1)
- `bulkProcessing.batchSize`: Files processed before memory cleanup (default: 100)
- `bulkProcessing.maxErrors`: Error threshold before stopping (default: -1, unlimited)
- `bulkProcessing.supportedExtensions`: Video file extensions to process
- `bulkProcessing.recursiveByDefault`: Default recursive behavior

## Technology Stack Validation


### Current Dependencies Analysis


- **System.IO.Abstractions**: ✅ Perfect for testable file operations
- **Microsoft.Extensions.Logging**: ✅ Excellent for structured progress logging
- **System.CommandLine**: ✅ Ideal for extended CLI commands
- **Microsoft.Data.Sqlite**: ✅ Sufficient for existing database operations

### Additional Dependencies Needed


- None - all required functionality available in existing .NET 8.0 stack

## Performance Considerations


### File Discovery Performance


- Use `EnumerationOptions.AttributesToSkip` to avoid unnecessary file attribute reads
- Implement directory pre-filtering to skip non-media directories
- Cache directory enumeration results for repeated operations on same directories

### Processing Performance


- Maintain existing single-threaded processing for compatibility
- Add optional concurrent processing with configurable limits
- Implement processing pipeline: Discovery → Validation → Processing → Reporting

### Memory Performance


- Streaming enumeration prevents large directory memory issues
- Configurable batch processing for memory-conscious operations
- Proper disposal of file handles and temporary objects

## Risk Assessment


### High Risk


- **Very large directories (100,000+ files)**: Mitigated by streaming enumeration and batch processing
- **Deep directory hierarchies**: Handled by recursion limits and exception handling

### Medium Risk


- **Network drives and slow storage**: Mitigated by timeout settings and progress reporting
- **Mixed file permissions**: Handled by graceful error handling and detailed logging

### Low Risk


- **Integration with existing identification logic**: Well-understood patterns and existing interfaces
- **CLI usability**: System.CommandLine provides robust help and validation

## Implementation Readiness


✅ All technical decisions made and validated
✅ Performance and memory strategies defined
✅ Error handling and resilience patterns established
✅ CLI design consistent with existing application
✅ Configuration integration approach confirmed
✅ Ready for Phase 1 (Design & Contracts)
