## User Scenarios & Testing

5. Generate Functional Requirements

### Primary User Story   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable



A user has video files containing DVD subtitles (VobSub format) ripped from physical DVDs or Blu-rays. These files do not have text-based subtitles (SRT, ASS) or PGS subtitles. The user wants the episode identification system to extract the subtitle content from the DVD subtitle track, convert it to text through OCR, and use that text to identify which episode the video file represents.



Currently, these files are rejected with an error message stating that DVD subtitle format is unsupported.



### Acceptance Scenarios



1. **Given** a video file with only DVD subtitle tracks and no text/PGS subtitles, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system extracts DVD subtitle content, performs OCR, and identifies the episode successfully   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements



2. **Given** a video file with both DVD subtitles and text subtitles, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system uses text subtitles (preferred format) and does not process DVD subtitles6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)

7. Run Review Checklist

3. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles in multiple languages, **When** user specifies target language, **Then** system selects the correct DVD subtitle track matching the language   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"



4. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles that OCR produces low-quality text, **When** identification confidence is below threshold, **Then** system reports ambiguous result with appropriate error message



5. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles containing special characters or formatting, **When** OCR processes the images, **Then** system normalizes the text output for episode matching



### Edge Cases



- What happens when DVD subtitle extraction fails due to corrupted subtitle data?   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"

- How does system handle DVD subtitles with unusual resolutions or color palettes?

- What happens when OCR produces no readable text from subtitle images?8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

- How does system handle very large subtitle tracks that could cause memory issues?```

- What happens when DVD subtitle track is detected but file extraction tools are missing?

## Requirements

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

### Functional Requirements

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY

- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when a video file contains DVD subtitle (VobSub/dvd_subtitle codec) tracks- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)

- **FR-002**: System MUST extract DVD subtitle content from video files into processable format (images)- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

- **FR-003**: System MUST perform OCR on extracted DVD subtitle images to convert them to text

- **FR-004**: System MUST prioritize text-based subtitles (SRT, ASS, WebVTT) and PGS subtitles over DVD subtitles when multiple subtitle formats are present### Section Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST select DVD subtitle track matching user-specified language when multiple language tracks exist

- **FR-006**: System MUST normalize OCR output text (remove formatting, timecodes, HTML tags) before episode identification- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature

- **FR-007**: System MUST handle OCR failures gracefully with clear error messages- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature

- **FR-008**: System MUST validate DVD subtitle extraction tools are available before attempting processing- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

- **FR-009**: System MUST report when DVD subtitle OCR quality is insufficient for confident episode identification

- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should extracted VobSub files be cached? Retention policy?]### For AI Generation

- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum processing time limit for VobSub extraction?]

- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Minimum OCR confidence threshold for episode identification?]When creating this spec from a user prompt:



### Non-Functional Requirements1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make

2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it

- **NFR-001**: DVD subtitle processing MUST not significantly increase overall episode identification time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define "significant" - 2x? 5x?]3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item

- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle DVD subtitle files of varying sizes without running out of memory [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum file size to support?]4. **Common underspecified areas**:

- **NFR-003**: OCR accuracy MUST be sufficient for episode matching [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define minimum accuracy percentage]   - User types and permissions

   - Data retention/deletion policies

### Key Entities   - Performance targets and scale

   - Error handling behaviors

- **DVD Subtitle Track**: A bitmap-based subtitle format embedded in video files, typically from DVD/Blu-ray sources. Contains subtitle images with timing information. Identified by codec name "dvd_subtitle" or "S_VOBSUB".   - Integration requirements

- **VobSub Files**: Intermediate extracted format consisting of .idx (index) and .sub (subtitle data) files extracted from the video container   - Security/compliance needs

- **Subtitle Images**: Individual PNG/bitmap images extracted from VobSub data, each representing one subtitle frame

- **OCR Text Output**: Text content extracted from subtitle images through optical character recognition, normalized and prepared for episode identification---



---## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*



## Dependencies & Assumptions### Primary User Story



### Dependencies[Describe the main user journey in plain language]



- Video files MUST be in MKV container format### Acceptance Scenarios

- DVD subtitle tracks MUST be embedded in the video file

- OCR engine MUST be available and configured [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Tesseract? Other OCR tools?]2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]



### Assumptions### Edge Cases



- DVD subtitles contain readable English text (or specified language)- What happens when [boundary condition]?
