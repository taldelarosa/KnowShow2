## User Scenarios & Testing



### Primary User Story

5. Generate Functional Requirements

A user has video files containing DVD subtitles (VobSub format) ripped from physical DVDs or Blu-rays. These files do not have text-based subtitles (SRT, ASS) or PGS subtitles. The user wants the episode identification system to extract the subtitle content from the DVD subtitle track, convert it to text through OCR, and use that text to identify which episode the video file represents.

   ‚úì Each requirement is testable

Currently, these files are rejected with an error message stating that DVD subtitle format is unsupported.



### Acceptance Scenarios

6. Identify Key Entities3. For each unclear aspect:

1. **Given** a video file with only DVD subtitle tracks and no text/PGS subtitles, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system extracts DVD subtitle content, performs OCR, and identifies the episode successfully

   ‚úì VobSub subtitle track, extracted images, OCR text output   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]

2. **Given** a video file with both DVD subtitles and text subtitles, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system uses text subtitles (preferred format) and does not process DVD subtitles



3. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles in multiple languages, **When** user specifies target language, **Then** system selects the correct DVD subtitle track matching the language

7. Run Review Checklist

4. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles that OCR produces low-quality text, **When** identification confidence is below threshold, **Then** system reports ambiguous result with appropriate error message

   ‚ö† WARN "Spec has uncertainties - clarifications needed"

5. **Given** a video file with DVD subtitles containing special characters or formatting, **When** OCR processes the images, **Then** system normalizes the text output for episode matching



### Edge Cases

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)

- What happens when DVD subtitle extraction fails due to corrupted subtitle data?

  - System logs error and returns appropriate error code without crashing```

- How does system handle DVD subtitles with unusual resolutions or color palettes?

  - Tesseract processes images regardless of format; poor quality results in lower confidence

- What happens when OCR produces no readable text from subtitle images?

  - System reports "OCR_FAILED" error with clear message---

- How does system handle very large subtitle tracks that could cause memory issues?

  - Tracks over 50MB are rejected with "SUBTITLE_TOO_LARGE" error before processing4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section

- What happens when DVD subtitle track is detected but extraction tools are missing?

  - System checks for mkvextract/Tesseract availability and reports "MISSING_DEPENDENCY" error## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"

- **FR-010**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should extracted VobSub files be cached? Retention policy?]### For AI Generation

## Clarification Decisions

- **FR-011**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum processing time limit for VobSub extraction?]

All ambiguities have been resolved with the following decisions based on existing codebase patterns:

- **FR-012**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Minimum OCR confidence threshold for episode identification?]When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Priority**: DVD subtitles are **lowest priority**. Priority order: Text subtitles (SRT/ASS/WebVTT) > PGS subtitles > DVD subtitles. Only process DVD when no other formats available.



2. **Performance**: Use existing configuration `DefaultFileProcessingTimeout` (default **5 minutes**). DVD subtitle extraction must complete within this timeframe or fail with timeout error.

### Non-Functional Requirements1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make

3. **Caching**: **No permanent caching**. Temporary files created during extraction are deleted after processing. This keeps storage requirements minimal and avoids cache management complexity.

2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it

4. **Quality**: Use existing `matchConfidenceThreshold` (default **50%**) for episode identification confidence. OCR must achieve **70% character recognition** rate for the text to be usable.

- **NFR-001**: DVD subtitle processing MUST not significantly increase overall episode identification time [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define "significant" - 2x? 5x?]3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item

5. **Scale**: Support DVD subtitle tracks up to **50MB** in size. Process images incrementally to avoid memory issues. Larger tracks should fail with appropriate error message.

- **NFR-002**: System MUST handle DVD subtitle files of varying sizes without running out of memory [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum file size to support?]4. **Common underspecified areas**:

6. **Tooling**: Require **mkvextract** (from mkvtoolnix package) for extraction and **Tesseract OCR** for text recognition. Both must be available on system PATH.

- **NFR-003**: OCR accuracy MUST be sufficient for episode matching [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define minimum accuracy percentage]   - User types and permissions

7. **Confidence**: Report standard success/fail/ambiguous states consistent with existing subtitle processing. Include OCR-specific error codes when recognition fails.

   - Data retention/deletion policies

### Rationale

### Key Entities   - Performance targets and scale

These decisions align with existing system patterns:

- Timeout matches existing `DefaultFileProcessingTimeout` configuration   - Error handling behaviors

- Confidence threshold uses existing `matchConfidenceThreshold` setting

- Error handling follows existing error code patterns (MISSING_DEPENDENCY, OCR_FAILED, etc.)- **DVD Subtitle Track**: A bitmap-based subtitle format embedded in video files, typically from DVD/Blu-ray sources. Contains subtitle images with timing information. Identified by codec name "dvd_subtitle" or "S_VOBSUB".   - Integration requirements

- No caching keeps system simple and stateless like current subtitle processing

- 50MB limit provides reasonable boundary for typical DVD subtitle tracks- **VobSub Files**: Intermediate extracted format consisting of .idx (index) and .sub (subtitle data) files extracted from the video container   - Security/compliance needs

- Tool requirements (mkvextract, Tesseract) are industry-standard open-source tools

- **Subtitle Images**: Individual PNG/bitmap images extracted from VobSub data, each representing one subtitle frame

- **OCR Text Output**: Text content extracted from subtitle images through optical character recognition, normalized and prepared for episode identification---
