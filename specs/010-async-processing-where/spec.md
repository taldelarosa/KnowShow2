# Feature Specification: Async Processing with Configurable Concurrency

**Feature Branch**: `010-async-processing-where`
**Created**: September 15, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "async processing where a configurable amount of files are processed simultaneously"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Extracted: async file processing with configurable concurrency control

2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: System, Administrator/User configuring concurrency
   → Actions: Process files asynchronously, Configure concurrency limits
   → Data: Files to be processed, Configuration settings
   → Constraints: Configurable simultaneous processing limit

3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Processing type clarified: Full episode identification workflow (subtitle ripping, hashing, database checking, renaming)
   → Configuration method clarified: User updates default value of 1 in existing episodeidentifier.config.json
   → Configuration timing clarified: Runtime adjustable via existing hot-reload process
   → Failure handling clarified: Use existing process - continue processing and output successes/failures in JSON at job completion

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary flow: Configure concurrency → Queue files → Process asynchronously
   → Testing scenarios defined based on concurrency limits and processing outcomes

5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on async behavior and configuration capabilities
   → Requirements marked where clarification needed

6. Identify Key Entities
   → ProcessingJob, ConcurrencyConfiguration, FileProcessingQueue

7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - multiple [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present"

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user wants to process a large batch of video files efficiently through the complete episode identification workflow (subtitle ripping, hashing, database checking, and renaming) by configuring the concurrency setting in `episodeidentifier.config.json` (default value 1) to allow multiple files to be processed simultaneously, balancing performance with system resources.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a collection of 100 video files and concurrency set to 5 in `episodeidentifier.config.json`, **When** episode identification processing starts, **Then** exactly 5 files undergo the full workflow (ripping, hashing, DB checking, renaming) simultaneously until all are complete
2. **Given** concurrency is set to 3 in the config file and 10 files are queued for episode identification, **When** one file completes the full workflow, **Then** the next queued file immediately begins the identification process to maintain 3 concurrent operations
3. **Given** the default concurrency value of 1 in `episodeidentifier.config.json`, **When** the user updates this value to 4 and the hot-reload process detects the change, **Then** the system immediately processes 4 files concurrently without requiring a restart
4. **Given** episode identification is running on multiple files, **When** individual files fail at any stage (ripping, hashing, DB lookup, renaming), **Then** other concurrent identification operations continue unaffected and all successes and failures are reported in JSON output at job completion

### Edge Cases

- What happens when concurrency is set to 0 or negative values in `episodeidentifier.config.json`?
- How does system handle when more files are queued than the concurrency limit allows?
- What occurs if system resources are insufficient to support the configured concurrency level during subtitle ripping or hashing operations?
- How are processing errors reported when multiple files are undergoing episode identification simultaneously?
- What happens when database connectivity issues occur during concurrent hash lookups?
- What occurs if the `episodeidentifier.config.json` file is malformed or missing the concurrency setting?
- How does the JSON output format handle reporting both successes and failures from concurrent operations?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support asynchronous execution of the complete episode identification workflow (subtitle ripping, hashing, database checking, renaming) on multiple files simultaneously
- **FR-002**: System MUST read concurrency configuration from the existing `episodeidentifier.config.json` file with a default value of 1
- **FR-003**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: validate concurrency configuration values - what are min/max limits?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain a queue of video files awaiting episode identification when demand exceeds concurrency limit
- **FR-005**: System MUST process queued files through the identification workflow as concurrent slots become available
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist concurrency configuration in `episodeidentifier.config.json` and apply changes immediately via the existing hot-reload process
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide feedback on episode identification progress for all concurrent operations, including current workflow stage (ripping, hashing, DB checking, renaming)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle individual file failures at any workflow stage without stopping other concurrent identification operations, continuing processing and collecting results for final JSON output
- **FR-009**: System MUST support dynamic concurrency adjustment during processing via hot-reload without interrupting active operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect system resource limits when executing concurrent subtitle ripping and hashing operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST coordinate database access efficiently when multiple files are performing hash lookups simultaneously
- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure file renaming operations don't conflict when processing files in the same directory concurrently
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle missing or malformed concurrency settings in `episodeidentifier.config.json` by defaulting to single-file processing
- **FR-014**: System MUST output comprehensive JSON results at job completion containing both successful and failed operations from all concurrent processing

### Key Entities

- **EpisodeIdentificationJob**: Represents a single video file undergoing the complete identification workflow with status tracking for each stage (ripping, hashing, DB checking, renaming)
- **ConcurrencyConfiguration**: Settings stored in `episodeidentifier.config.json` that define maximum simultaneous episode identification operations (default: 1)
- **IdentificationQueue**: Manages the ordered list of video files awaiting episode identification processing when concurrency limits are reached
- **ProcessingPool**: Manages active concurrent identification operations and coordinates resource allocation for subtitle ripping, hashing, and database operations
