# Feature Specification: Identify Season and Episode from AV1 Video via PGS Subtitle Comparison (CLI, JSON Output)


**Feature Branch**: `002-build-an-application`
**Created**: September 7, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an application that can identify the Season and Episode number of a provided AV1 encoded video file by extracting the PGS subtitles and comparing them to other known labelled subtitles that exist on the file system in a folder structure of Subtitles=>Series=>Season. This will be part of an automated workflow so it will only run on the command line and will always output JSON responses."

## Execution Flow (main)


```

1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"









2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints









3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]









4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"









5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable








   → Mark ambiguous requirements

6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"








   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"

8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines


- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements


- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation


When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### Primary User Story


A user (or automated workflow) provides an AV1 encoded video file via the command line. The system extracts the PGS subtitles, compares them to a set of known, labelled subtitles organized in a Subtitles=>Series=>Season folder structure, and returns the identified Season and Episode number as a JSON response.

### Acceptance Scenarios


1. **Given** a valid AV1 video file with embedded PGS subtitles, **When** the user runs the CLI tool with the file path, **Then** the system outputs a JSON object with the correct Season and Episode number based on subtitle comparison.
2. **Given** a video file with no or unreadable PGS subtitles, **When** the user runs the CLI tool, **Then** the system outputs a JSON error message indicating identification is not possible.
3. **Given** a video file that is not AV1 encoded, **When** the user runs the CLI tool, **Then** the system outputs a JSON error message indicating unsupported file type.

### Edge Cases


- What happens when the provided video file is not AV1 encoded? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system reject non-AV1 files or attempt processing?]
- How does the system handle subtitle files with partial or poor matches? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the minimum match threshold for identification?]
- What if multiple episodes have highly similar subtitles? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should ties or ambiguities be reported in JSON?]
- How are subtitle language mismatches handled? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the system support multiple languages or only a default?]
- What is the expected JSON schema for output (fields, error structure)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Please specify required JSON structure.]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements


- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users (or automated workflows) to provide an AV1 encoded video file via the command line.
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract PGS subtitles from the provided video file.
- **FR-003**: System MUST compare extracted subtitles to a database of known, labelled subtitles organized in a Subtitles=>Series=>Season folder structure.
- **FR-004**: System MUST output the identified Season and Episode number as a JSON object if a match is found.
- **FR-005**: System MUST output a JSON error message if identification is not possible due to missing or unreadable subtitles.
- **FR-006**: System MUST output a JSON error message for unsupported file types (e.g., non-AV1 files) and stop processing. Note in the error message that non-AV1 files will be supported in a later release.
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle cases where multiple matches are found and report ambiguity in the JSON output. This is only done when there is no confidence score higher than 90%. The System will return the path of the top 3 subtitles with the highest match confidence in the error message.
- **FR-008**: System MUST define a minimum match threshold for subtitle comparison. This is configurable. The default is 0.92
- **FR-009**: System MUST clarify supported subtitle languages. English is the preferred default but other languages can be used with the proper flag.
- **FR-010**: System MUST always output responses in JSON format, including errors and status messages.
- **FR-011**: System MUST log all identification attempts for audit purposes.
- **FR-012**: System MUST support integration into automated workflows (non-interactive, no prompts).

### Key Entities


- **Video File**: Represents the user-provided AV1 video, with attributes such as file name, encoding type, and embedded subtitles.
- **PGS Subtitle**: Represents the extracted subtitle data, including language, timing, and text/image content.
- **Labelled Subtitle Database**: A collection of known subtitles, each labelled with Series, Season, and Episode metadata, organized in a Subtitles=>Series=>Season folder structure.
- **Identification Result**: The output entity containing the matched Series, Season, Episode, match confidence, and any ambiguity notes, all in JSON format.
