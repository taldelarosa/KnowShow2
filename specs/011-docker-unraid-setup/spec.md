## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As an Unraid server administrator, I want to deploy the Episode Identifier as a container so that I can automatically or manually identify and organize my video files without installing dependencies directly on the host system.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a fresh Unraid server, **When** I install the Episode Identifier container, **Then** the container starts successfully without requiring manual dependency installation
2. **Given** a running container with mapped video directories, **When** I execute the identification command on a video file, **Then** the file is correctly identified using PGS subtitle extraction
3. **Given** an existing subtitle hash database, **When** I restart or recreate the container, **Then** the database persists and previously learned subtitles remain available
4. **Given** a configuration file with custom settings, **When** I update the configuration, **Then** the container reflects the new settings without rebuilding
5. **Given** a directory of video files, **When** I run bulk processing, **Then** all files are processed with the configured concurrency level
6. **Given** processed files with identified episodes, **When** I enable auto-rename, **Then** files are renamed according to the configured template

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the hash database file is corrupted or missing?
- How does the system handle video files that are actively being written (partial downloads)?
- What happens if OCR language packs are missing from the container?
- How does configuration hot-reload work within the container environment?
- What happens when mapped volumes are unavailable or permissions are incorrect?
- How are container logs accessed for troubleshooting?

### ‚úÖ Operational Mode - RESOLVED

**Decision**: Manual execution via CLI commands

**Rationale**:
- Users typically process files in batches after downloads complete
- Watch mode adds complexity and potential resource overhead
- Can be added in future phases if demand exists
- Fits existing CLI-based workflow
- Users can schedule execution via Unraid's User Scripts plugin or cron

### ‚úÖ User Interface - RESOLVED

**Decision**: CLI-only operation with Unraid Docker UI template

**Rationale**:
- Unraid users are familiar with docker console/exec commands
- Unraid Docker UI template makes installation and configuration user-friendly
- Web UI adds significant complexity and maintenance burden
- Template can expose key config options via UI (paths, thresholds, concurrency)
- Keeps implementation focused on core functionality
- Documentation will guide setup via Unraid's Docker container UI

### ‚úÖ Integration Requirements - RESOLVED

**Decision**: Standalone operation (Phase 1)

**Rationale**:
- External integrations (Radarr/Sonarr/etc.) can be achieved via post-processing scripts
- Users can integrate via Unraid's User Scripts plugin
- Keeps container focused and maintainable
- Documentation will provide integration patterns and examples
- Future phases can add native API integrations if needed

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- Must work within Unraid's Docker implementation
- Must respect file permissions and ownership (Unraid uses PUID/PGID)
- Must not require privileged container mode unless absolutely necessary
- External dependencies (FFmpeg, Tesseract, etc.) must be included in container

### Assumptions

- Users have basic familiarity with Unraid container management
- Video files are accessible via network shares or local storage
- Unraid server has sufficient resources (CPU, RAM) for video processing
- Users understand the need for persistent volumes for database and config

### Dependencies

- Unraid 6.9+ (or compatible Docker environment)
- Sufficient storage for container image and video processing
- Network access for initial container image download
- Existing video files with PGS subtitles for identification

---

## Success Criteria

The feature is successful when:

1. ‚úÖ A user can install the container on Unraid without manual dependency installation
2. ‚úÖ The container successfully identifies episodes from video files using mapped directories
3. ‚úÖ The subtitle hash database persists across container restarts
4. ‚úÖ Configuration changes take effect without container rebuild
5. ‚úÖ All current application features work identically within the container
6. ‚úÖ Container logs provide sufficient information for troubleshooting
7. ‚úÖ Documentation enables non-technical users to deploy and use the container
8. ‚úÖ Container can process files with correct ownership/permissions on Unraid shares

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:

- Web-based user interface (CLI-only for Phase 1)
- Automatic watch folder monitoring (manual execution only)
- Native API integration with Radarr/Sonarr/Plex (documentation for script-based integration will be provided)
- GPU acceleration for video processing
- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Multi-architecture support (ARM builds) in initial release
- Automatic updates mechanism (Unraid handles container updates)
- Built-in backup/restore for database (users manage via Unraid backup tools)
- Network-based processing (container accessing remote servers)
- Unraid Community Applications store submission (can be added in future phase)
