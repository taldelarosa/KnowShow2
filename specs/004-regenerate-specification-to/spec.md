## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

Content creators and media librarians need to automatically identify TV show episodes from video files by analyzing embedded subtitles. Users want to maintain a database of known episodes and automatically identify unknown episodes by comparing subtitle content using fuzzy matching techniques.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has AV1 video files with embedded PGS subtitles, **When** they run identification against a populated database, **Then** the system returns the series name, season, and episode with confidence score
2. **Given** a user has subtitle files with known episode information, **When** they store them in the database, **Then** the system creates searchable entries for future identification
3. **Given** a user has a directory of properly named subtitle files, **When** they run bulk ingestion, **Then** the system automatically parses filenames and stores all episodes
4. **Given** a user provides a video file that doesn't match any known episodes, **When** identification is attempted, **Then** the system returns the closest matches with confidence scores for manual review

### Edge Cases

- What happens when subtitle extraction fails due to missing dependencies?
- How does the system handle multiple subtitle tracks in different languages?
- What occurs when fuzzy matching finds multiple episodes with similar confidence scores?
- How does the system respond to corrupted or unreadable video files?
- What happens when attempting to store duplicate episodes in the database?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Identification Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract PGS (Presentation Graphics Stream) subtitles from AV1-encoded video files
- **FR-002**: System MUST convert image-based PGS subtitles to searchable text using OCR technology
- **FR-003**: System MUST compare extracted subtitle text against a database of known episodes using fuzzy matching
- **FR-004**: System MUST return identification results with series name, season number, episode number, and confidence score
- **FR-005**: System MUST support confidence thresholds to determine match quality and ambiguity warnings

#### Storage and Database Requirements

- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to store known subtitle content with series, season, and episode metadata
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent duplicate episode entries in the database using database-level constraints
- **FR-008**: System MUST support bulk ingestion of subtitle files from directories with automatic filename parsing
- **FR-009**: System MUST parse TV show information from standardized filename formats (e.g., "SeriesName - 1x01 - EpisodeName.srt")
- **FR-010**: System MUST store multiple normalized versions of subtitle text for robust fuzzy matching

#### Language and Accessibility Requirements

- **FR-011**: System MUST support multiple subtitle languages with user-specified language preferences
- **FR-012**: System MUST automatically select appropriate subtitle tracks when multiple tracks are available
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide fallback mechanisms when preferred language tracks are unavailable
- **FR-014**: System MUST support international character sets and Unicode text processing

#### Interface and Output Requirements

- **FR-015**: System MUST provide a command-line interface for automation and scripting
- **FR-016**: System MUST output all results in structured JSON format for machine consumption
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide comprehensive error messages with specific error codes for different failure scenarios
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate input files and provide clear feedback for unsupported formats

#### Performance and Reliability Requirements

- **FR-019**: System MUST process subtitle extraction and matching within reasonable time limits for typical video files
- **FR-020**: System MUST handle large subtitle files and databases efficiently
- **FR-021**: System MUST provide detailed logging for troubleshooting and monitoring
- **FR-022**: System MUST clean up temporary files automatically after processing

#### Data Normalization Requirements

- **FR-023**: System MUST normalize subtitle text by removing HTML tags and timecode artifacts
- **FR-024**: System MUST create multiple normalized versions for comprehensive comparison strategies
- **FR-025**: System MUST use advanced fuzzy matching algorithms that compare all normalization combinations
- **FR-026**: System MUST handle ambiguous matches by reporting multiple candidates with confidence scores

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **VideoFile**: Represents an AV1-encoded video file with embedded PGS subtitle tracks, including metadata about subtitle languages and track indices
- **SubtitleTrackInfo**: Contains information about individual subtitle tracks including language, format, and track index within the video container
- **LabelledSubtitle**: Represents known episode subtitle content with series, season, episode metadata and normalized text versions
- **IdentificationResult**: Contains episode identification output including series/season/episode identification, confidence score, and any ambiguity warnings or errors
- **SubtitleDatabase**: Persistent storage of known episodes with fuzzy hash indices and normalized text versions for efficient matching
- **ParsedFilename**: Represents metadata extracted from subtitle filenames including series name, season/episode numbers, and episode titles
