# Feature Specification: NonPGS Subtitle Workflow

**Feature Branch**: `006-adding-nonpgs-workflow`  
**Created**: September 8, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED  
**Implementation Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Test Results**: 46/46 tests passing (8 unit + 8 integration + 30 contract)  
**Input**: User description: "Adding nonPGS workflow. When PGS subtitles are not found in the video but other text based subtitles like .srt are found they are directly extracted and then we do the normal workflow where we compare to the sqlite db entries and provide the matching series/season/episode"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user has a video file that does not contain PGS (Presentation Graphic Stream) subtitles but does contain other text-based subtitle formats (such as .srt, .ass, .vtt files). The user wants to identify the series, season, and episode of this video using the text-based subtitles instead of falling back to manual identification or failing completely.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a video file with no PGS subtitles but with .srt subtitle track, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system extracts .srt text and proceeds with normal database matching workflow
2. **Given** a video file with both PGS and .srt subtitles, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system prioritizes PGS subtitles as before (no behavior change)
3. **Given** a video file with no PGS subtitles and multiple text-based subtitle tracks, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system processes each text subtitle track until successful match or all tracks exhausted
4. **Given** a video file with text-based subtitles that don't match any database entries, **When** user runs episode identification, **Then** system returns "no match found" result with indication that text subtitles were processed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when text-based subtitle files are corrupted or unreadable?
- How does system handle very large text subtitle files that might impact performance?
- What happens when text subtitles contain unusual encoding or special characters?
- How does system prioritize multiple text subtitle tracks (different languages, hearing impaired, etc.)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when video files contain no PGS subtitles ‚úÖ
- **FR-002**: System MUST identify and extract text-based subtitle formats (.srt, .ass, .vtt) from video files ‚úÖ
- **FR-003**: System MUST process extracted text subtitles through the existing fuzzy hash comparison workflow ‚úÖ
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain existing PGS subtitle priority (process PGS first when available) ‚úÖ
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear indication in results when text subtitles were used instead of PGS ‚úÖ
- **FR-006**: System MUST process all available text subtitle tracks sequentially until a successful database match is found ‚úÖ
- **FR-007**: System MUST gracefully handle text subtitle extraction failures and continue to next available subtitle track ‚úÖ
- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve all existing functionality for PGS subtitle processing (no regressions) ‚úÖ

### Key Entities ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
- **Text Subtitle Track** (`TextSubtitleTrack.cs`): Represents non-PGS subtitle content with format type, language, and extracted text content
- **Subtitle Format Handler** (`ISubtitleFormatHandler` interface): Manages extraction logic for different text-based subtitle formats
  - `SrtFormatHandler.cs`: Handles SubRip (.srt) format with regex-based parsing
  - `AssFormatHandler.cs`: Handles Advanced SubStation Alpha (.ass) format 
  - `VttFormatHandler.cs`: Handles WebVTT (.vtt) format
- **Subtitle Processing Result** (`SubtitleParsingResult.cs`): Contains identification results with metadata indicating which subtitle source was used
- **Interface Architecture**: Clean separation with `ISubtitleExtractor` and `ISubtitleMatcher` interfaces

### Implementation Details ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- **Robust Error Handling**: All format handlers detect malformed UTF-8 data and invalid encoding
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 46 tests passing (8 unit + 8 integration + 30 contract tests)
- **Format Detection**: Content-based format detection using headers and patterns
- **Text Extraction**: Regex-based parsing with HTML tag stripping and dialogue extraction
- **Encoding Support**: UTF-8 validation with fallback error handling
