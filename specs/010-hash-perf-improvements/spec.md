# Feature Specification: Hash Performance Improvements with Series/Season Filtering


**Feature Branch**: `010-hash-perf-improvements`
**Created**: October 7, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Hash Perf improvements. Lets make searching faster by letting the users optionally provide the series and season when searching for matching hashes in the database as oftentimes users will have this information and it saves us from doing a whole DB comparison"

## Execution Flow (main)


```

1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature: Optimize hash database search performance by allowing optional series/season filtering

   → Core concept: Reduce database comparison scope when user has series/season context

2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Users with episode identification needs

   → Actions: Provide optional series/season hints to improve search performance
   → Data: Hash database, series names, season numbers
   → Constraints: Must remain optional (backwards compatibility)

3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Performance target not specified - what constitutes "faster"?

   → Search interface modifications needed but not detailed

4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary: User knows series/season and wants faster identification

   → Secondary: User doesn't know series/season, uses current workflow








5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable








   → Mark ambiguous requirements

6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"


5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Optional series/season input parameters

   → Filtered database queries for performance
   → Backwards compatibility maintenance

6. Identify Key Entities
   → Series names, Season numbers, Hash records, Search filters


7. Run Review Checklist
   → Specification ready for planning phase


8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*


### Primary User Story


A user has a video file they want to identify and already knows it belongs to a specific TV series (e.g., "Bones") and possibly the season (e.g., Season 2). Instead of comparing against the entire hash database containing thousands of episodes across all series, they can provide this context to dramatically reduce search time by only comparing against episodes from that specific series and season.

### Acceptance Scenarios


1. **Given** a user has a video file and knows it's from "Bones" Season 2, **When** they provide series="Bones" and season=2 as optional parameters, **Then** the system searches only Bones Season 2 episodes and returns results faster than a full database search

2. **Given** a user has a video file and knows it's from "Bones" but not the season, **When** they provide series="Bones" only, **Then** the system searches only Bones episodes across all seasons

3. **Given** a user has a video file with no series/season knowledge, **When** they perform identification without optional parameters, **Then** the system performs a full database search as it currently does

4. **Given** a user provides an invalid series name, **When** the system searches the database, **Then** it returns no matches or appropriate error message without crashing

### Edge Cases


- What happens when the provided series name doesn't exist in the database?
- How does the system handle case sensitivity in series names (e.g., "bones" vs "Bones")?
- What happens when season number is provided without series name?
- How does the system behave with partial series name matches?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*


### Functional Requirements


- **FR-001**: System MUST accept optional series name parameter for hash searching
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept optional season number parameter for hash searching
- **FR-003**: System MUST filter hash database queries based on provided series/season parameters
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backwards compatibility when no series/season parameters are provided
- **FR-005**: System MUST return search results faster when series/season filtering is applied compared to full database search
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle case-insensitive series name matching
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate that season numbers are positive integers when provided
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide clear error messages for invalid series/season combinations
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to provide series name without season number for series-level filtering
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to provide both series name and season number for maximum filtering precision
- **FR-011**: System MUST return an error message when season parameter is provided without series parameter

### Performance Requirements


- **PR-001**: Hash searches with series filtering MUST be measurably faster than full database searches (any measurable improvement is acceptable)
- **PR-002**: Hash searches with series+season filtering MUST be faster than series-only filtering
- **PR-003**: System MUST handle series/season filtering without increasing memory usage compared to full database searches

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*


- **Series Name**: String identifier for TV series (e.g., "Bones", "Breaking Bad"), case-insensitive matching
- **Season Number**: Positive integer representing season within a series
- **Hash Record**: Database entry containing episode hash data with associated series and season metadata
- **Search Filter**: Optional parameters that constrain database query scope for performance optimization
