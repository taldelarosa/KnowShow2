# Tasks: Hash Performance Improvements with Series/Season Filtering

**Input**: Design documents from `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/specs/010-hash-perf-improvements/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Overview

This feature adds optional `--series` and `--season` parameters to the identify command for performance optimization through database query filtering. All changes are backwards compatible and follow strict TDD principles.

**Tech Stack**: C# / .NET 8.0, SQLite, System.CommandLine, xUnit
**Key Files**:
- `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/src/EpisodeIdentifier.Core/Services/FuzzyHashService.cs`
- `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/src/EpisodeIdentifier.Core/Commands/IdentifyCommands.cs` (to be created/modified)
- `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/tests/contract/FilteredHashSearchTests.cs` (to be created)
- `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/tests/integration/SeriesSeasonFilteringTests.cs` (to be created)

## Phase 3.1: Setup

- [ ] **T001** Verify existing test infrastructure supports multi-series databases
  - Path: `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/tests/contract/TestDatabaseConfig.cs`
  - Verify: Existing TestDatabaseConfig can handle multiple series
  - Action: Add helper methods if needed for multi-series test data

- [ ] **T002** Create test data fixtures for multi-series scenarios
  - Path: `/mnt/c/Users/Ragma/KnowShow2-charlie/tests/data/multi-series/`
  - Create: Sample subtitle files for Bones, Breaking Bad, The Office (3+ episodes each)
  - Format: Follow existing subtitle file structure

## Phase 3.2: Tests First (TDD) ‚ö†Ô∏è MUST COMPLETE BEFORE 3.3

**CRITICAL: These tests MUST be written and MUST FAIL before ANY implementation**

## Parallel Execution Examples

### Parallel Block 1: Contract Tests (After Setup)

```bash
# Can run simultaneously - different test files
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FilteredHashSearchTests.AcceptsSeriesFilter"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FilteredHashSearchTests.AcceptsSeasonFilter"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FilteredHashSearchTests.SeasonWithoutSeriesThrows"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FilteredHashSearchTests.CaseInsensitiveMatching"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CLIFilteringTests.SeriesOptionExists"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CLIFilteringTests.SeasonOptionRequiresSeries"
```

### Parallel Block 2: Integration Tests (After Contract Tests)

```bash
# Can run simultaneously - different test files
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SeriesSeasonFilteringTests"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~BackwardsCompatibilityTests"
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~FilteringPerformanceTests"
```

### Parallel Block 3: Documentation (After Implementation)

```bash
# Can work on simultaneously - different files
# Task: Update README.md
# Task: Add XML docs to FuzzyHashService.cs
# Task: Run quickstart.md validation
```

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All contract tests pass
‚úÖ All integration tests pass
‚úÖ All existing tests still pass (backwards compatibility)
‚úÖ Performance improvement measurable and documented
‚úÖ CLI help text includes new options
‚úÖ Error messages clear and helpful
‚úÖ Code follows existing style conventions
‚úÖ Zero breaking changes to API or CLI

## Notes

- **TDD Enforcement**: Do NOT skip the RED phase. Tests must fail before implementation.
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Critical requirement. All existing code must work unchanged.
- **Performance**: Any measurable improvement is acceptable per specification.
- **Case Sensitivity**: Series matching must be case-insensitive per FR-006.
- **Database**: No schema changes required - uses existing Series/Season columns.
