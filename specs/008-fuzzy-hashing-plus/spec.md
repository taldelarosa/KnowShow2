# Feature Specification: Fuzzy Hashing Plus Configuration System

**Feature Branch**: `008-fuzzy-hashing-plus`  
**Created**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "fuzzy hashing plus configs. The app will now read a JSON config file for match threshold, name confidence threshold, and filename templates. It will also use Context-triggered piecewise hashing (CTPH) instead of SHA1/MD5 hashing."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Key concepts identified: configuration system, fuzzy hashing, CTPH algorithm
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: users/administrators configuring thresholds
   → Actions: reading config files, applying thresholds, using CTPH hashing
   → Data: match thresholds, confidence thresholds, filename templates, hash values
   → Constraints: JSON format, CTPH algorithm requirement
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Marked configuration storage location and validation requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Clear user flow: configure thresholds → apply to episode identification
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement testable and specific to configuration and hashing
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Configuration, HashingAlgorithm, MatchingThreshold entities
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Some configuration details need clarification
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a system administrator or power user, I need to configure the episode identification system with custom matching thresholds and filename templates so that the system can be tuned for different content libraries and identification accuracy requirements. The system should use more sophisticated fuzzy hashing to improve matching accuracy while allowing fine-tuned control over matching behavior.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a JSON configuration file with match threshold settings, **When** the system starts, **Then** it loads and applies these thresholds for episode identification
2. **Given** configured name confidence thresholds, **When** identifying episodes, **Then** the system uses these thresholds to determine match quality
3. **Given** filename templates in the configuration, **When** renaming files, **Then** the system applies the configured naming patterns
4. **Given** the CTPH hashing algorithm is enabled, **When** comparing files, **Then** the system uses fuzzy hashing instead of exact hash matching
5. **Given** invalid configuration values, **When** loading the config file, **Then** the system reports clear validation errors and uses safe defaults

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the configuration file is missing or corrupted?
- How does the system handle invalid threshold values (negative, > 100%, non-numeric)?
- What occurs when filename templates contain invalid characters or patterns?
- How does fuzzy hashing perform with very small or very large files?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST read configuration from a JSON file containing match thresholds, name confidence thresholds, and filename templates
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate all configuration values and reject invalid settings with clear error messages
- **FR-003**: System MUST use Context-triggered piecewise hashing (CTPH) algorithm for file comparison instead of SHA1/MD5
- **FR-004**: System MUST apply configurable match threshold values when determining episode identification accuracy
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply configurable name confidence threshold values when evaluating filename matches
- **FR-006**: System MUST use configurable filename templates when renaming or organizing identified episodes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide default configuration values when config file is missing or invalid [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what should the default threshold values be?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support hot-reloading of configuration changes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should config changes apply immediately or require restart?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST log configuration loading success and any validation errors
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing file identification workflows

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Configuration**: JSON structure containing match thresholds (numeric), name confidence thresholds (numeric), and filename templates (string patterns)
- **HashingAlgorithm**: CTPH-based fuzzy hashing implementation that produces similarity scores rather than exact hash matches
- **MatchingThreshold**: Configurable numeric values (0-100%) that determine when file similarities qualify as matches
- **FilenameTemplate**: Configurable string patterns that define how identified episodes should be named/organized
